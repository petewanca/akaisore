<h1 align='center'>Akaisore</h1>

<h2>🧠 About</h2>
<p>Japanese for "Red" and "It". Akaisore is a 'JavaScript client' for Reddit. The client is built using React and utilizes a <a href='https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components'>styled components</a> library I put together with minimal help from a single CSS sheet.</p>

<h2>🍊 Description</h2>
<p>Ever wanted to pass a little down-time at your desk without getting angry glares from coworkers? Perhaps you're waiting for your next meeting to start or you're taking lunch from your desk. With this application, you're able to browse Reddit under the shroud of JavaScript. The JSX from React that's rendered in the DOM is styled to look like JavaScript with ES6 syntax. <a href='https://petewanca.github.io/akaisore' target='_blank'>Have a look around!</a></p>
