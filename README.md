<h1 align='center'>Akaisore</h1>

<h2>🧠 About</h2>
<p>Japanese for "Red" and "It". Akaisore is a 'JavaScript client' for Reddit. The client is built using React and utilizes a <a href='https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components'>styled components</a> library I put together with minimal help from a single CSS sheet.</p>

<h2>🍊 Description</h2>
<p>Ever wanted to pass a little down-time at your desk without getting angry glares from coworkers? Perhaps you're waiting for your next meeting to start or you're taking lunch from your desk. With this application, you're able to browse Reddit under the shroud of JavaScript. The JSX from React that's rendered in the DOM is styled to look like JavaScript with ES6 syntax. <a href='https://petewanca.github.io/akaisore' target='_blank'>Have a look around!</a></p>

<h2>👩🏽‍💻 Further Development</h2>
<p>With v1 completed as of April 1, 2020, the intention is to continue adding features to Akaisore over time. If you have suggestions or would like to contribute, feel free to fork and create a PR or shoot me an email at the address listed above. The goal was to keep the inital release of Akaisore as lightweight as possible. With that, v1 is client-side only but I plan to continue expanding on this every few weeks/months.</p>
<p>Here's a short list of items I'd like to add on next:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Listing replies to comments as opposed to only top level comments.</li>
    <li>Pagination for additional post and comment results.</li>
    <li>Improved styling for nested parentheses, curly braces, methods and objects/values.</li>
    <li>Adding a wait to comment loading to prevent from errors breaking the application. 🤣</li>
    <li>User authentication via OAuth to enable user sign-in for personalized Reddit experience.</li>
</ul>
